    "description": "The AmazonLambda Connector allows you to access the REST API of Amazon Web Service Lambda (AWS Lambda) , which lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code in one of the languages that AWS Lambda supports (currently Node.js, Java, C#, Go and Python) and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.
